    	<p>Proper training starts and ends in the kitchen. An ideal diet for athletes, body builders, figure models and fitness buffs alike is designed to amp up strength, provide energy during workouts, increase muscle recovery rates, and keep the machine &mdash; the body &mdash; running strong and sickness-free. Stimulating muscle growth boosts the ability for "force production". Greater energy means more stamina for blasting through intense workouts. Quicker muscle recovery ensures a fresh body for workouts. Staying illness-free provides more time and more opportunity to maximize time in the gym. A diet that supports these goals is key to seeing results, as the time surrounding a workout has the potential to intensify or diminish all the hard work done in the gym. Dumbbell's Kitchen serves as a guide for serving up the ultimate nutrition guide to pair with even the most ass kicking of workouts.</p>
